# Movie Recommender System - Project Overview

## Introduction

This project implements a movie recommender system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), presented through a Flask web application. The system allows users to browse movies, rate them, and receive personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

## Project Goals

1. Build a functional movie recommendation system using SVD algorithm
2. Create a user-friendly web interface for browsing and rating movies
3. Implement personalized recommendations based on user ratings
4. Provide a smooth user experience with proper authentication and session management
5. Demonstrate the implementation of collaborative filtering techniques in a real-world application

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering
2. **Backend**: Flask-based web server handling requests, routing, and business logic
3. **Database**: MongoDB for storing movie data, user information, and ratings
4. **ML Component**: SVD-based recommendation engine for generating personalized suggestions

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Login/registration system with session management
- **Movie Catalog**: Browsable collection of movies with details
- **Rating System**: Ability for users to rate movies they've watched
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Custom movie suggestions based on user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for browsing on any device

## Development Approach

The project will be developed incrementally, following the approach outlined in the tutorial:

1. **App Version 1**: Basic Flask application setup
2. **App Version 2**: Frontend templates and static assets
3. **App Version 3**: Data integration and template rendering
4. **App Version 4**: MongoDB database integration
5. **App Version 5**: User authentication and session management
6. **App Version 6**: SVD model integration and personalized recommendations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Jinja2
- **Database**: MongoDB with Flask-MongoEngine
- **ML Library**: Surprise library for SVD implementation
- **Authentication**: Flask-Security for user management
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF for form handling and validation

## Data Sources

The recommendation system will be built using movie data, potentially from one of these sources:
- MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- TMDB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
- IMDB datasets (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)

## Target Audience

- Movie enthusiasts looking for personalized recommendations
- Users who want to keep track of movies they've watched and rated
- Developers interested in recommendation systems and web application development

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Adding content-based filtering alongside collaborative filtering
- Implementing real-time model updates based on new ratings
- Adding social features like sharing recommendations
- Integrating external APIs for movie trailers and additional information
- Enhancing the UI with more interactive elements
